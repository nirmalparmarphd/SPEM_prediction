Salt Production Enhancement Method (SPEM): Machine and Deep Learning data-driven solution to predict the salt production

# Research Work Collaboration
This resesach work was carried out with collbration of Nirmal Parmar (Data Drive Solution & Deep Learning at ICPF, Prague, CZ) and Bipin Vyas (Experimental Work at Salt farm, CSMCRI, CSIR, India).
The first aim of the research work is to conduct an experiment with the SPEM method and collect data. The second aim was to find a data-driven solution to predict salt production in different weather conditions in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India.
